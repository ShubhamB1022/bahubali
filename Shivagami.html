    <p><b><i>Rajamatha (Queen Mother) Sivagami Devi is the former regent of the Mahishmati kingdom. She is a skilled fighter, feared by her enemies and seen to have thwarted enemies' plots to overthrow the kingdom. She is a true leader who treats everyone equally, including her son and nephew. She is a strong headed leader and the most powerful character in the Baahubali series, who decides the fate of Mahishmati. The first movie of the series portrays her as judicious in her decisions. The second movie of the series shows her grey side. She has her own imperfections: pride, temper and inflexibility, all of which lead her to persecute Amarendra Baahubali for marrying Devasena.</p>

        <p>Her father was ordered to be executed for treason by Maharaja Somadeva, Bijjaladeva's father and she was raised by her foster father Thimma. Sivagami became the foster mother of Amarendra Baahubali whose mother, her foster sister Akhila, died after giving birth to him. She assumes the guardian role of the throne until the princes are ready to rule the kingdom. Sivagami raises both her nephew Amarendra Baahubali and her son Bhallaladeva to be worthy heirs to the throne and when the time comes she decides to make one of them a king of Mahishmati. After a war with the Kalakeyas, Sivagami proclaims Baahubali as the new king of Mahishmati. She is manipulated by her husband Bijjaladeva and son Bhallaladeva into ordering Kattappa to kill Amarendra Baahubali, her nephew. Realising her mistake, she sacrifices her life in the attempt to save Mahendra Baahubali, the son of Amarendra Baahubali, from Bhallaladeva's treachery.</i></b></p>
