    <p><b><i>Mahendra Baahubali was born in Mahishmati on the day his father Amarendra Baahubali was executed by Kattappa and his mother Devasena was held captive by Bhallaladeva. Sivagami later flees with him from the castle to save him from Bhallaladeva and gives up her life to save him. The child is then found by Sanga and her husband belonging to a tribe who lives beyond the kingdom. The couple raises him as their own. Many years later, Mahendra climbs the waterfall and eventually enters Mahishmati. He rescues his mother Devasena and slays Bhallaladeva's son. Mahendra Baahubali is the spitting image of Amarendra Baahubali.</p>

       <p> Kattappa narrates the story of his heritage. Upon learning the truth, Mahendra rouses the people of Mahishmati to revolt against Bhallaladeva. In the ensuing battle, Bhallaladeva and Baahubali engage in a duel and Baahubali defeats Bhallaladeva. Baahubali's mother, Devasena, kills Bhallaladeva by immolating him alive. Baahubali later becomes the king of Mahishmati and marries Avantika. He has similar qualities to that of his father, like being creative, loyal, realistic, practical, wise, and valiant.</i></b></p>
