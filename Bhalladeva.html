    <p><i><b>Bhallaladeva (Palvaalthevan in Tamil) is the king of Mahishmati. He is a renowned fighter, Sivagami and Bijjaladeva's only child and the older cousin-brother of Amarendra Bahubali. He is envious of Amarendra Baahubali. When he is made King, he relieves Amarendra of his official duties and later convinces Sivagami that Amarendra is trying to assassinate him.</p>
        <p>Bhallaladeva takes Devasena as a prisoner and frequently taunts her in her captive. Devasena later burns him alive on a funeral pyre she prepared for him after Mahendra Baahubali defeats him in a battle. In this way she reduces Bhallaladeva to ashes to repay for all the bad that he has done. After his death, his golden statue was disposed of by the order of king Mahendra Baahubali.</b></i></p>
