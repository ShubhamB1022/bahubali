    <p><b><i>Karikala Kattappa Nadar aka Kattappa is the Commander of the King's royal bodyguard and Capital guards. Though he is a very skilled warrior for the Crown of Mahishmati, Kattapa's forefathers, beginning with Ugrappa, pledged their allegiance and loyalty to the rulers of Mahishmati for their assistance in avenging against Vaithalikas. He was appointed as the royal bodyguard of Bijjaladeva by the incumbent king, Somadeva, after he saved the lives of Bijjaladeva and Mahadeva (who later got the title of Vikramadeva).</p> <p>He was ordered by Sivagami and Bhallaladeva (then rulers) to kill Baahubali.He kills Amarendra Baahubali under order of the royals, later realizing that he was fooled. Though Kattappa is a servant of the royal family, he is addressed as "Mama" (maternal uncle) by Amarendra Baahubali & revered as a father figure by Devasena, so he is addressed as "Thatha" (grandfather) by Mahendra Baahubali. After Amarendra's death, he wanted to free Devasena from the clutches of Bhallaladeva, which she refused. On meeting Shivudu, he revolted against the rule of Bhallaladeva under the former's leadership.</i></b></p>
