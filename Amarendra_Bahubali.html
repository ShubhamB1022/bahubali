    <p><b><i>Amarendra Baahubali, Maharaja Vikramdeva's son, was born in Mahishmati. His mother (then Queen Dowager) died while giving birth to him. He was named "Baahubali" by his aunt, Rajamatha Sivagami, who later became his foster mother. She recognized his leadership qualities and announced him as the next king after he succeeded in a contest to defend the empire from the Kalakeya invasion. Though Bhallala Deva killed the Kalakeya king Inkoshi</p> <p>Baahubali was announced as the next king as he showed more honor in the battle. He is envied by Bhallaladeva who manipulates Sivagami and issues an order to Kattappa to execute Baahubali for treason. He is loyal and bound by his promise even at the cost of his throne. He is the father of Mahendra Baahubali alias Sivudu. He was married to Devasena.</p> <p> He is a skilled warrior with both his sword and the arrows, specializing in fighting with the battleaxe. He can shoot 3 arrows in a single string. He has good battle strategy skills, which proved useful in the battle against the Pindari tribe.</p></i></b>
