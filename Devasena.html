    <p><i><b>Devasena is the lead female character of the Baahubali franchise along with Sivagami. Princess of Kuntala Kingdom, Devasena is a skilled fighter and a great archer. Amarendra Baahubali falls in love with her during a visit to Kuntala kingdom. Devasena reciprocates in her feelings toward him. She is brave and bold and believes firmly in her decisions, and it is through great practice that she achieves her martial skills. Devasena marries Baahubali. Bhallaladeva wants Devasena's hand in marriage and makes his mother Sivagami promise that he would marry Devasena. Devasena (now in love with Baahubali) rejects the marriage proposal by Bhallaladeva and chooses Baahubali instead. Furious, Sivagami declares Bhallaladeva the new king of Mahishmati.</p>

        <p>Baahubali eventually dies at the hands of Kattappa, his trusted companion. On the day Baahubali dies, Devasena gives birth to Mahendra Baahubali. Sivagami eventually learns the truth about Bhallaladeva's treachery. Bhallaladeva orders his men to capture Devasena while Sivagami flees with baby Mahendra in her arms.</p>
        
       <p> Devasena is then tormented for the next 25 years. During her time in captivity, she prepares a funeral pyre for Bhalla. She promises that she will reduce Bhalla to ashes by burning him alive on the funeral pyre she has prepared. She would eventually be freed by her son Mahendra Baahubali (now called Sivudu/Shiva). Her son, Sivudu, after learning about his father's heritage and demise, sets out to avenge his death. </p>
        
        <p>After Mahendra defeats Bhalla in the battle, Devasena reduces Bhalla to ashes by burning him alive to death on the funeral pyre. In this way she takes her revenge. After Bhallaâ€™s death, Devasena becomes the new Queen Mother (Rajamatha) and announces Mahendra Baahubali as the new king of Mahishmati kingdom.</p>

     <p>She is rebellious, a fierce warrior who fights for what is just. Like the other female leads of the series, she is strong and independent in her decisions and opinions. She fights alongside Mahendra Baahubali during the Mahishmati revolt and protects Devasena during the trial by fire ritual at the end of the sequel,</b></i></p>
